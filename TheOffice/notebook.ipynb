Of all these iterations (including the original), the American series has been the longest-running, spanning 201 episodes over nine seasons.</p>\n","<p>In this notebook, we will take a look at a dataset of The Office episodes, and try to understand how the popularity and quality of the series varied over time. To do so, we will use the following dataset: <code>datasets/office_episodes.csv</code>, which was downloaded from Kaggle <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset\">here</a>.</p>\n","<p>This dataset contains information on a variety of characteristics of each episode.
